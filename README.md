PUmore is PHPUnit fork that add some new features, such as divide tests into chunks.
PHPUnit is a programmer-oriented testing framework for PHP. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks.

## Installation

For the time being,
We don't distribute a [PHP Archive (PHAR)](https://php.net/phar) yet.
Maybe in the future if someone really needed it.

Alternatively,
you may use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to download and install PUmore as well as its dependencies.

The steps are simple :
a. install composer
b. cd project_folder_path
c. composer install phibi/pumore --dev

If you need to install it as Global Package, here is :
a. install composer as Global
b. cd ~.config/composer
--- or any directory you install composer
c. composer global install phibi/pumore
